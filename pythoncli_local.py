You've said the unsaid secrets of divine nature, by a mere glance.)</p> <p>The above-stated kalam is considered Amir Khusroh’s one of the finest works, where he is seen praising his spiritual mentor Hazrat Nizamuddin Awliyah. There has been widely accepted conjecture that Amir’s devotion to his awliyah wasn’t exclusively limited to his spiritual, religious needs but also his romantic affiliations. </p> <p>Ancient Indian art and architecture, since time immemorial, has depicted a few scattered references to same-sex unions. Sexual fluidity has been portrayed in our ancient texts like Kamasutra, which acknowledged the existence of Tritiya panthi (the third gender), and in the depiction of the homoerotic sculptures at temples like Khajuraho, Konark and Hampi . There is no living evidence of homosexuality being outlawed, existing from the precolonial era. Satirically, it was our white masters, the Victorians, who imposed this quaint sense of morality on us. A majority of the Indian population went on to become the inheritors of a mindset which scandalized sex and related practices, while the Victorians became successful in their pursuit of erasing our past. </p> <p>On October 6, 1860, the Indian Law Commission, presided over by Lord TB Macaulay, introduced section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The intend of the section was to punish the offence of buggery, sodomy and bestiality. However, it went on to criminalize all forms of sexual practices which did not come under the purview of heterosexual activities or sexual activities performed for any purpose, other than procreation. The long-drawn battle against Section 377 culminated with the Supreme Court judgement of September 6, 2018. The court ruled that the application of Section 377 to consensual homosexual sex between adults was unconstitutional, indefensible, and arbitrary , and thus decriminalised the consensual practices. </p> <p>On a careful analysis of the above judgement, Navtej Singh Johar v The Union of India , an optimist might argue that it has principally laid down a precise road map for future judges to rely upon. It can be interpreted to rule that ‘gay’ marriage can be (and should be) permitted in India. The judgement was based on the idea of the ability of a person, belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community, to love a member of the same sex. Consequently, giving them a right that their relationship will be treated as equal to that of a heterosexual couple. </p> <p>The fundamental basis of the Art. 14 and Art. 21 arguments, i.e., the right to equality and the right to freedom argument in the above-cited judgement, are to allow every individual to achieve their autonomy. Every soul should have the right to choose their sexual partner or their partner in life, irrespective of their gender or sexual orientation. </p> <p>The contention that now arises is that the moment you allow one to have an intimate relationship with any person of their choice, irrespective of any bias, logically then marriage is nothing but a legal sanction. Marriage, in this sense, becomes a societal construct.</p> <p>There have been (and will be) instances where a minuscule portion of a society prefers a notion or aspires to put into practice a phenomenon that is deemed “different” from a majoritarian lens. What we need to understand here is that this portion is impeccably competent to have the freedom, to be different and thus prefer different things, as long as their unique tastes remain within the legal framework and do not result in the abridgement of fundamental rights of any other citizen.</p> <p>Any attitude which according to the societal purview is distorted, must at the bare minimum be afforded an environment in which it could perpetuate, if not promoted, provided it is within the constitutional framework. If such an approach isn’t adopted, freedom of expression would fail to prosper and the right to liberty and freedom, which is the epitome of constitutional morality, would cease to survive.</p> <p>We, the people of India, have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular and a democratic republic where virtues such as justice, liberty, equality and fraternity will be secured to each citizen, irrespective of any bias or binary . Even when the (highly subjective) principles and morals in the society remain as orthodox or rigid as possible, nevertheless, the constitutional provisions will apply because India is a country of constitutional supremacy and not a country built upon majoritarian demands and societal acceptance. </p> <p>Surveys have indicated that a large majority of homosexual men in India (including MSMs; self-identified heterosexual men who, nonetheless, indulge in sexual practices with other men outside their immediate household) are married in heterosexual setups. This might look like a trivial issue at first glance but is quite detrimental to the societal wellbeing, which the so-called ethical majority is aggressively trying to protect. Such men are forced to fit in within the heteronormative setup of their surroundings and never truly acknowledge the double life they are living. Human dignity and integrity of the individual deteriorate. The argument here is more legal than moral in the sense that the wife here is devoid of her right to demand a divorce on the grounds of infidelity and remains deceived throughout. </p> <p>The belief that a biologically born male is exclusively sexually attracted to a biologically born female is what is called heterosexism. This idea has become a hegemonic construction of heterosexuality through performativity . </p> <p>In a beautifully constructed article in The Print, Saurabh Kirpal argues: </p> <p class="text-center"><em>“Marriage has certain social and economic consequences. When two individuals get married… there are mutual rights that the parties to the marriage have… one partner cannot simply walk away and marry someone else… The laws of inheritance recognize a married spouse and give him or her a right in the property of the other... there are insurance and tax benefits, which unmarried couples do not have. These benefits, both instrumental and intrinsic, which extend to all married couples do not currently extend to same-sex partners.” </em></p> <p>Legal recognition will carve the path for easy property transfers (after the uncertain death of any spouse), gender-neutral implementation of adoption rights and inheritance policies. On a moral front, it can also be argued that when a certain phenomenon gets legal validation, the inclusion of it in the society not only becomes simpler but also, perhaps, speeds-up substantially. </p> <p>Recent judicial developments, demanding recognition of same-sex unions within the Special Marriage Act or Hindu Marriage Act, have also taken place. However, for any of these to be implemented, a bill will have to be passed in a Parliamentary body for the required amendment of the already existing and related legislations. The need of the hour is to make our laws, related to familial constructs and unions, much more gender-neutral, omitting the words such as wife and husband and replacing them with partner or spouse. </p> <p>However, judicial interpretation even in situations like these has proved to be a boon for society. In a landmark judgement (in April last year), the Madras High Court held that the expression “bride” in Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 can be extended, in its meaning, to include a transwoman, an intersex person and/or a transgender person who perceives herself as a woman.  On the other hand, in Shafin Jahan v. Asikan K.M. , the right to marry any person of one’s choice was held to be an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution. </p> <p>Sex cannot be seen through a lens of morality, especially when morality itself is highly subjective. The reference to heterosexual love as “normal”, and, by implication, homosexual love as “abnormal”, is a smack of homophobia. The whole point of decriminalization was to show that homosexual love is not different from any other type of love. To call homosexuality an ‘inclination’ or a ‘tendency’ as opposed to a ‘preference’ would again be unjust. </p> <p>Therefore, marriage equality is essential to fulfil the vision of our honorable Constitution makers in which they envisaged a society build on the virtues of liberty, equality and integrity. </p> {% endblock blogpost %}''')

The huge criticism is propounded on the doctrine of ‘secularism’ and demands the termination of such practices in its entirety. At the same time, some countries have also played a significant role in limiting the right to freedom of religious and culture expression by imposing laws concerning only the state authorities. Both secular as well as theocratic states have thus played a role in the amplification of religious as well as cultural intolerance amongst the masses.</p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Often, we stumble upon a news article stating the restriction of specific symbol or clothing due to profound religious discrimination that exists worldwide. Or in other cases (such as the Middle East countries), we discover religious dress codes being enforced on women against their will, for such theocratic states use ‘religion’ as a means to campaign for the ‘immortal’ patriarchy. Women are often told what to wear and what not to, either by their own family members or the people around them. The most disheartening thing to see in today’s time is that the very fundamental laws that were made to protect human rights now mandate people to wear clothes or symbols according to one’s country belief or ideologies. Why is there a constant need to make people wear things against their own form of self-expression? Even the most secular states (in ‘written constitution’) resort to restricting people’s Right to clothing. The recent ban of headscarves worn by Muslim women as a form of their religious expression in France speaks volumes of the increasing demolition of the Right to freedom of expression. Hence, this paper attempts to discuss the impact of such laws restricting people’s Right to expression of religion and culture in society through country-specific case studies and tries to find a pragmatic solution to the problem.</p> <p>Many laws drafted by states also reflect upon the suppression of one gender, restricting them in their prescribed gender norms. As in most cases, it is woman’s clothing that is questioned by society at large. Theocratic states consisting of one state religion, such as Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, incorporate different, harsh punishments for the women (who are the so-called divine symbols of a country’s religious stature) in case they fail to abide by the religion-based laws (Doumato). Such practices contribute towards grave human rights violations in the hands of several country- specific legislations around the globe. And hence in order to safeguard the rights and will of citizens at large, such laws call for speculation in view of the international treaties and conventions.</p> <p>While there has been research conducted on the violation of the Right to religious freedom of expression with the proposition of laws, we attempt to analyse the laws of different political systems and their sociological impact on its citizens. Focussing on the different models of approach, the discourse of the paper will try to deduce the best model that should be followed.</p> <h2>I. Countries whose legal system is enshrined with the doctrine of 'secularism'</h2> <h3>A. Secular State: France</h3> <p>Over the years, various countries have enshrined different legal systems in accordance with varied socio-religious dynamics. Similarly, in France, there exists a separation between state authority and religion. The French Constitution encourages the principle of laïcité, wherein the French state and government avoid taking a stance on matters of religious significance and maintains neutrality towards the religious beliefs of the masses (Mohanty 46). Adding to this pretext, people are required to keep their personal and public life separate as two different dimensions wherein one’s religious form of expression should not come in light of the public sphere. Although such principles were formulated in order to keep uniformity and equality amongst its citizen, it fails to account for the various international documents that cherish the foundational principles of secularism and modernity (which mostly all European countries are signatories of) (Črnič 113). Such conventions and declarations promote the persistence of humanity and tolerance amongst the global citizens. And thus, the signatories ought to respect such provisions and incorporate the same within their national boundaries. While in reality, many countries construct their own interpretations to suit their country’s own narrative and belief.</p> <p>In practical terms, it is evident to notice that most religions are not concerned with one practising one’s religious beliefs according to any preferred surroundings. Religious codes strive to regulate a person’s entire life and hence do not differentiate between public and private lives (Mohanty 46). If any religion requires one to wear a religious attire or symbol, it is to be carried in both public and private spheres. Thus, it is inherently impossible for a person to profess their faith with complete freedom in a country like France (where one is forbidden to express their faith in public). It implies that a “secular” country such as France does not uphold the basic fundamental rights as they find their roots deeply embedded in the laïcité principle. Moreover, France guarantees equality of all irrespective of one’s religion, and at the same time, refuses to include religion as a matter of the state. Such a provision is extremely problematic when it comes to safeguarding or protecting one’s individual rights, and at the same time demolishes the essence of the same ‘secularism’ that the state vowed to stand for.</p> <p>In 2004, the French government passed a law banning “conspicuous religious symbols’ such as the Muslim headscarf, Sikh turban and the Jewish skullcap. Furthermore, in 2010, a law was passed forbidding Muslim women to conceal their faces in public, robbing them of their Right to freedom of religious expression. Similarly, in 2021, the French Senate’s move to ban the hijab for girls under the age of 18 in the public sphere led to widespread criticism and massive protests worldwide (#HandsoffMyHijab). While it has not been passed yet, it showcases that such laws formulated in the name of “French secularism” deprive people of the root essence of the principle of ‘secularism’ where all individuals are guaranteed the freedom of religion to practice and profess in whichever way that suits them. Amnesty International stated that this proposed ban of headscarves poses a “serious attack on rights and freedom in France” and demanded the scrapping of “many problematic provisions” (Aljazeera). Moreover, such propositions in the court of law prevent the states from formulating social reforms for religious minorities residing in the country. While it is noteworthy that religious minorities are subjected to atrocities committed in the name of ‘intolerance’, the state by virtue of its neutral stand in matters of religious significance would then do nothing to cherish and protect its people (minorities).</p> <h3>B. Secular State: South Africa</h3> <p>Like many other countries such as New Zealand, Canada, South Africa is known to respect religious and cultural diversity, and the Constitution itself safeguards the people’s Right to the Expression of Religion in both public and private spheres. The makers of the constitution for the state of South Africa have inherently made sure to respect the diversified needs and whims of the citizens. Owing to its vehemently prolonged period of attaining Independence (getting rid of the elitist white superiority), this particular nation has efficiently provided legislations so as to protect the sentiments of the plethora of races and religious beliefs which continue to strive on its motherland. People are free to profess their religions respectfully without the constant fear of being subjected to grave punishments by the state authorities itself.</p> <p><strong><em>Constitutional Provisions related to Right of Religion:</em></strong></p> <p>Article 9 of the South African Constitution ensures equality to the citizens with no discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs. Article 31 of the same Constitution gives the Right of practising one’s culture to any religious or religious community. Moreover, Article 15, enshrined in the Bill of Rights, ensures religious observances in public institutions and facilities, provided that the rules are followed in accordance with the authorities.</p> <p>The Constitution of South Africa accommodates the interests of all religions and thus holds true to the essence of ‘secularism’. Unlike the French approach to secularism and freedom of religious expression wherein the state maintains ‘neutrality’ by not getting engaged in the matters of religion, the South African approach recognises the fundamental rights of an individual by incorporating rights associated with religious freedom within the ambit of state affairs. The concept of religious observation enclosed within the national boundaries might seem not so ‘uniform’ to a country that follows the French approach. Nevertheless, in reality, the South African model owing to its high significance and pragmatic approach, is practised vividly in countries such as India and Canada. These countries allow people to express religious symbols in both public as well as private spheres, without any restrictions imposed by inhumane laws.</p> <h3>C. Secular State: India<br>(Partial Separation between State and Religion)</h3> <p></p> <p><strong><em>Constitutional Provisions relating to Right of Religion (source the Constitution of India):</em></strong><br></p> <ul> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 25</span>: Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 26</span>: Freedom to manage religious affairs.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 27</span>: Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 28</span>: Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions.</li> </ul> <p>After the formation of two different countries post-independence in 1947, India came to be known as a secular state safeguarding religious and cultural rights to each individual regardless of their personal belief. The state thus intervenes in matters related to religious affair and helps in the formulation of various religion-based laws for various socio-political reasons. Justice K. Ramaswamy by stating that “secularism is, therefore, part of the fundamental law and basic structure of the Indian political system to secure to all its people socio-economic needs essential for man’s excellence with material and moral prosperity and political justice,” very well articulates the root foundations of this very secular diverse state (Singh 599). The laws and legislations allow the people to wear religious attires and symbols in both the private and public sphere, not restricting it to certain preferred surroundings or closed spaces. People across the Indian territory wear burqas, niqabs, turbans, sarees, and many other religious symbols. And if one gets discriminated against or harassed for practicing their expression of religion, they can knock on the doors of the court for an infringement of their personal right. India, owing to its multicultural society, thus, tries to accommodate the rights of all its citizen. And inherently provides with adequate legislation for the ones who have somehow faced the brunt of religious discrimination or intolerance. The Indian approach to the principle of ‘secularism’ differs from the French approach of ‘secularism’ (based on laïcité principle) as the Indian model advocates for the doctrines of inclusivity (based on religious communities) and humanity. While France prides itself aligning with the principles of ‘secularism’, it is India (and many other countries who recognize the Right to Freedom of Religion and Expression) which truly stands as a secular state in its entirety. Furthermore, the South African approach to secularism was drafted on the same lines as the Indian one, as they both stand for the Right to freedom of religious expression (clothing in this case). With the rise of modernity and liberalism, people possess the will to carry out anything with their desire, and not even the national laws can curtail one’s human rights in its claws.</p> <p>However, there have been several challenges to the idea of secularism within the country. One of the main challenges to secularism in India is religious and communal politics, which stems from conflict in interest. Since the 1980s, we have seen the rise in formation of the various religion-based organizations, such as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Shiv Sena and All Indian Muslim League, who use their power to gain political mileage and thus influence the masses in creating a divide between the different religious communities (Singh 603). While it looks like such organizations may be secular in theory but on the contrary, many of them possess a radical approach in handling handle affairs related to religious interests. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) reports of 2016 and 2018, the practice of anti-conversion laws (Mathur) (in different states) are significantly used to “create a hostile, and on occasion violent, environment for religious minority communities” as they are misused to create communal differences among the people (Love-Jihad law recently passed in Uttar Pradesh is one such law used inappropriately in many cases). Although the Constitution of India was formulated keeping in the ideas of secularism, freedom to religion and democracy in the 1940s, it has now started to sweep away from its roots lately.</p> <p>With the growing communal indifferences in the recent years, Rakesh Bajrangi, a Bajrang Dal leader, proposed the ban of pheran in the Kashmir valley while claiming that clothing helps the militant carry firearms. In 2014, Kashmiri journalists were forbidden from wearing this cultural attire at different events held by these occupational forces. However, it was soon scrapped off due to the enormous criticism it brought upon itself. Moreover, Satya Pal Malik, the Governor of J&K in 2018, banned people from wearing pheran at a few of its offices (Malik). The practice to ban a piece of clothing is submissively present in the Indian territories as well. While the government fails to recognize the importance of a cultural attire in the lives of ordinary people, it also infringes the Right to freedom of cultural and religious expression, guaranteed to its citizen with the help of the Constitution. It is therefore necessary for the people ‘sitting in power’ to not use its impressionable citizens for their own political gain. And it is equally important for the citizens of India to reinvent the foundational principles of its native territory and respect the rich cultural diversity of various communities residing in the same ecosystem.</p> <h2>I. Countries whose legal system is not enshrined with the doctrine of 'secularism'</h2> <h3>A. Theocratic State: Saudi Arabia<br>(No separation between the state and religion)</h3> <p>The Basic Law of Governance (1992) of Saudi Arabia states Islam as the official religion of the state, and the Constitution is thus drafted according to the principles and teachings of the Quran. The legal system is formulated on the basis of the sharia law (Interpreted as per the Hanbali School of Sunni Islamic Jurisprudence) and therefore does not recognize any religion other than Islam (Doumato 568). Freedom of religion is prohibited, and the citizens are not allowed to practice or profess their religions in public spheres. Although it allows people to practice their faith within the boundaries of their domestic spheres, it fails to comply with the fact that religious practices (other than that of Islam) are not limited to restricted spaces. Moreover, the law criminalises “the promotion of atheistic ideologies in any form” and “any attempt to cast doubt on the fundamentals of Islam,” or publications that “contradict the provisions of Islamic law” (International Religious Freedom Report 2020). And thus, condemns the display of non-Islamic symbols and other acts involving religious worship.</p> <p> In theocratic countries like Saudi Arabia, the state is closely linked to matters of religious affairs (unlike the French approach mentioned in the above section) and are responsible for drafting laws as per their conservative beliefs. While one country is forcing women to wear niqabs and abayas to preserve Islamic ideologies (Saudi Arabia), the other is proposing laws to ban such religious attires from public places (France). What these both countries inculcate in commonality are the forced measures undertaken to deny the Right to freedom of expression of religion and culture. It is crucial to notice that though France constitutes itself as a “secular” state imbibing the principles of equality, it is, in this case, stepping on the path laid down by a theocratic state like Saudi Arabia. Both countries disregard the true essence of democracy and secularism, for they are very much radical in understanding jurisprudence.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>With the discourse of the paper, we have tried to discuss the persistence of laws infringing or guaranteeing the Right to Freedom of Religious as well as cultural expression. We realise that due to the increasing awareness of human rights and the formation of secular-democratic countries, the way forward would therefore be propounded on the principle of inclusivity. It is thus fair to say that it is time that France should terminate the age-old laïcité principle involving secularism and try to switch towards the nuances of modernity. While it may seem like an impressionable mind would get influenced by a certain religion due to the religious freedom of another’s expression, such apprehension is not true in its entirety. The display of symbols and attires of different religious faiths inculcate the element of togetherness amongst people. It also helps us to accept people for whom they are meaningful, making us tolerant towards the citizens living in a society. </p>{% endblock editorialpost %}''')

In this article we will shed some light on the challenges that the OBC reservations have had to face through judgements of courts and more importantly answer: whether the demand of Jats and Marathas to be enlisted as OBCs was/is a constitutionally sound demand or not as per the interpretations of the court?</p> <h2 id="sec-introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Reservation is an old tradition in India, and it is not uncommon to see society divided based on caste. Its origin can be traced back to ancient times when the practice of 'untouchability,' the caste system, and the Varna system was prevalent. In the descending order of their social hierarchy, Hindu society was divided into Varna or classes: Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Shudras. In addition, there was another class of people known as "untouchables" or "Avarna," which means "without class." These untouchables were deemed unfit for society and were therefore removed from the social system. They were forced to live outside of the village and had no social rights. The legal component of reservation in India dates back to 1919 when the Government of India Act was enacted. This legislation addressed various minorities' difficulties, including establishing communal electorates, and Montague-Chelmsford criticized it because he feared it would impede India's self-development. After 1919, the Simon Commission was formed in 1927, in which seats were reserved for the underprivileged, and there was a need for a broader franchise since the poor's economic, educational, and social circumstances did not allow them to vote appropriately. In 1931, a Round Table Conference was held in London to examine the changes suggested by the Simon Commission. Mahatma Gandhi and Congress strongly opposed these changes, which resulted in the unsolved issue of the minority in the conference. </p> <h2 id="sec-post-independence-scenario">Post-Independence Scenario</h2> <p>The situation changed after independence, and the reservation strategy acquired even more excellent traction. When our own Constitution was drafted, the framers included a special provision to provide equal opportunity in public employment to all Indian citizens. The same provision was included in Article 16 of the Indian Constitution. However, to protect the underprivileged, a specific provision was placed in the same Art. Clause 4 (Art. 16) (4). This clause authorizes the state to make special provisions for those backward classes that, in the state's opinion, are not effectively represented in the state's service. Consequently, Mandal commission was set up, and was responsible for implementing OBC reservations. In 1979, the Janata Government, led by Prime Minister Sri Morarji Desai, established the second Backward Classes Commission, chaired by Sri B.P. Mandal, under Article 340 of the Constitution to investigate the socially and educationally backward classes within India’s territory and suggest initiatives to be taken for their progress, including the essential provisions that must be made for them for the upliftment of their status via equal opportunity in public employment. </p> <p>The panel issued its report in 1980, identifying around 3743 castes as socially and educationally backward groups and recommending a 27% quota in government positions. It was not implemented at the time, but Prime Minister V.P. Singh issued an office memorandum in 1990, reserving 27% of seats for the socially and economically backward groups. For three months, this reservation generated massive chaos among Indian citizens. A writ petition was filed in front of the Supreme Court, challenging the validity of the Government's office of memorandum. The matter was referred to a 9-judge bench known for its landmark decision of Indra Sawney v Union of India in 1992. They questioned the reservation standards, including whether caste alone may form a class or if economic criteria alone are sufficient to identify backwardness. They analyzed various factors and found that financial measures alone are insufficient to determine a class's backwardness. To safeguard the citizen rights, they devised the notion of a creamy and non-creamy layer and a 50% threshold on the reservation. </p> <h2 id="sec-background-of-jats-and-marathas-reservation-case-2014">Background of <em>Jats</em> and <em>Marathas</em> reservation case 2014</h2> <h3 id="sec-maratha-reservation">Maratha Reservation</h3> <p>The State of Maharashtra adopted an ordinance on July 9, 2014, allowing the Maratha to group a 16 per cent quota in education and public jobs. An interim order was granted to postpone the legislation's execution. Following that, Maharashtra implemented the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2014, resulting in a 16% quota for educationally and socially backward classes, including the Maratha community. The Maharashtra state government established the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission in January 2017. The Commission, led by Justice Gaikwad, proposed a 12 per cent and 13 per cent quota for Marathas in educational institutions and public sector employment, respectively, which were implemented in 2018. The act was challenged in front of the Bombay High Court because it was allegedly unconstitutional. The demand for reservation was motivated by an upsurge in the incidence of suicides among Maratha families due to indebtedness and declining incomes. The Bombay High Court confirmed the constitutional legality of the statute in 2019 because the state has the authority to increase the quota. On July 12, 2019, the Supreme Court admitted an appeal against the verdict of the Bombay High Court and issued a notice to the Maharashtra state government. However, it opted not to stay the Bombay High Court's decision. The case was referred to a bigger bench. The decision, in this case, was declared lately on May 5, 2021, and the court decided not to grant reservations since it exceeded the 50% reservation cap . </p> <h3 id="sec-jat-reservation">Jat Reservation</h3> <p>The Jat group is a north Indian martial and farming community that is not historically seen as "backward." For decades, Jats have demanded reservation in Central and State Government Jobs. The UPA government issued a notification incorporating the Jat group on the Central OBC list. Still, the Supreme Court overturned it in 2014, arguing that caste cannot be the only reason for reservation. The Haryana government promised the Jats a special backward class quota based on economic status, but it was a non-negotiable arrangement for the Jats; therefore, they turned it down. The court held that if Haryana added a Jat quota to the current OBC (27%) + scheduled castes & scheduled tribes (22.5%), it would violate the Supreme Court's cap of 50 per cent reservations due to which they were denied reservation in the central OBC list. </p> <p>A similar thread in both cases was that they both cited Article 15 of the Indian Constitution and presented their justification for reservation, which revolved mainly on their inability to obtain suitable employment or education. Whether it is because of caste or because of their precarious financial situation. Another thing that was similar in both circumstances was that their demand for reservations exceeded the 50% limitation, which was ruled in the landmark 1992 case of <strong>Indira Sawney v Union of India</strong>. Hence, the principal reason for refusing their reservation request exceeded the 50 per cent threshold in both situations. Another scenario was for people to comprehend what a backward class is and who is deemed backwards. The National Commission for Backward Classes defines OBC as educationally, socially, and economically backwards, implying that other castes should regard the caste as socially backwards. Educationally, the caste's non-enrollment in schools should be at least 25% higher than the state average, and economically, the typical caste family's assets should be at least 25% lower than the state average. </p> <h2 id="sec-why-obc-reservation-is-controversial">Why OBC reservation is controversial</h2> <p>Over 32.6 million Jats dwell in India, with Haryana accounting for around 29 per cent of all Jats. When the Supreme Court rejected Jats' petition to be included on the central OBC list in 2014, its judgment stated that Jats make up 29 per cent of Haryana's population. They are politically and economically prosperous. They are also better off in terms of education. The demand to be classified as OBC will help them secure the 27 per cent OBC reservation in government employment. However, according to the Supreme Court, "social backwardness" is the fundamental factor in determining backwardness; caste alone cannot be used to justify reservation. </p> <p>Jats were one of India's thirty-six royal races in ancient times. In Indian history, Jats from Himachal Pradesh were considered equal to Kshatriyas, whereas Jats from Rajasthan were deemed equivalent to Rajput’s. Their children received higher education in a variety of fields. During contemporary India, the British admired the Jats for their agricultural and military skills. Whether in ancient times or now, it is apparent that the Jats possessed the resources, talent, and means to be socially and economically stable. They never had to confront what other castes, like SC and ST, have had undergone in the past or present. Because they are well-off, the majority of the OBC does not require reservations. According to a 2019 International Monetary Fund research, OBC has the fastest intergenerational mobility of any community, even upper castes. They are landlords with a variety of properties and a decent education and job opportunities. Many politicians fall within the OBC group as well. Certain OBC indeed requires a reservation, which is why the notion of the creamy-non-creamy layer was introduced, but it is apparent that it is quickly taken advantage of. In a country like the Republic of India, the administration is riddled with its own inconsistencies. It is not difficult to forge fake documents and prove that one belongs to the non-creamy OBC group. The fact that OBC is given reservations based only on their caste and not on their actual need makes OBC reservations controversial. </p> <h2 id="sec-conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Reservation has long been a controversial topic. Reservation is founded on the concept of equitable representation, and it is used as a tactic or as a compensatory exercise to combat prejudice and exploitation caused by caste discrimination, and caste hate against the SC, ST, and OBC's. Reservation has long been a controversial topic. So, to compensate for and overcome the historical denying castes' disadvantages and provide a barrier against caste exploitation, it was decided that the solution must be created solely based on caste and not economy. Reservation was formerly a fundamental right, but the Supreme Court ruled in <strong>Mukesh Kumar v. State of Uttarakhand</strong> that the right to reservation is no longer a fundamental right. It stated that a state has to take certain steps, including research and study, before introducing a reservation but none such studies have to be conducted before scraping them. Giving fundamental rights for reservation is the same as impeding the nation's development, advancement, and efficiency from all perspectives. </p> <p>On one hand, our Constitution states that we are a free and sovereign country. On the other hand, the reservation framework enslaves all of these perspectives, causing dissimilarity and differences among individuals. Reservation is vital to some extent. However, some unnecessarily demand reservation even if they are adequately represented. The most vulnerable classes within the protected sections are unaware of how to benefit from the provision or even that such provisions exist. It is not fair to provide reservation to someone who lives the same life as a general, or maybe a better one. If the reservation policy continues in this manner, it will eventually become a discriminatory procedure. Every year, the policy should be evaluated, and a poll should be done to see whether the most vulnerable among the “backward” are receiving benefits. There is a great need for mental change, for which awareness and education are critical, and it is only through education that fundamental human ideals can be instilled. In addition, well-off backward groups must step out and declare that they are self-sufficient and capable enough to require reservations no longer. </p> <hr> <h3 id="sec-references"><em>References</em></h3> <ol> <li id="ref1">Item 1</li> <li id="ref2">List Item</li> <li id="ref3">List Item</li> <li id="ref4">List Item</li> </ol> {% endblock editorialpost %}''')

These three branches are further individually divided into more sub-categories. The main three branches have horizontal power sharing, they are of equal stature and supposedly share equal powers even though each has separate functions to perform, and within the branches the power sharing is vertical, where power decreases as you go down the levels. A great example of vertical power sharing is the power difference between the Supreme Court (the apex court) and the district courts though both are part of Judiciary but don’t share equal powers. The functions and obligations of each branch is specified however there are times when the powers overlap, in a vertical power sharing system overlapping is not an issue as the more powerful one gets to decide in the end but in a horizontal power sharing system this becomes a concern. In this article we will look at the decisions of courts regarding such overlap of powers between Executive and Legislative, furthermore discuss the Pros and Cons of having such overlaps.</p> <h2 id="sec-introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>The Indian Constitution was adopted by the constituent assembly on January 26, 1947, and came into effect on November 26, 1950, however the parliamentary system existed since 1927 and was allowed to continue in the newly made Constitution of India. The Indian Constitution has several unique elements that set it apart from other international constitutions. It is the longest Constitution; it is thorough because it deals with the complicated and diversified circumstances that existed (and still exists) at the time of its formulation and adoption after the British granted India independence. A federal parliamentary system of Government with well-defined and demarcated duties for the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary was established because one organ cannot conduct all functions in a coordinated and sufficient manner. The core of parliamentary Government is the head of state, who also serves as the constitutional head. However, the true executive powers are vested in the Council of Ministers, led by the Prime Minister, who takes executive action on behalf of the head of state (the President of India) and is India's first organ. The legislative, which consists of the President, the Parliament (the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha), and the state legislatures, is India's second institution. The Judiciary is the third organ, and its provisions are included in Chapters IV and VI of the Constitution. In India, the Constitution, not the Parliament, is supreme, as it is in England. In that sense, the Indian Parliament is not a sovereign body because it derives all of its powers from the Constitution. The Indian Constitution establishes a clear division between India's three organs. The allocation of the Government's political, administrative, and judicial responsibilities is referred to as the separation of powers. It reduces the possibility of unlawful governmental activities since the implementation, compliance, and execution of laws must be sanctioned by all three branches. To comprehend whether or not legislative and executive powers overlap, one must first grasp how they vary from one another. </p> <h2 id="sec-separation-of-power">Separation of Power</h2> <p>Charles-Louis de Secondat, baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, an 18th century French social and political philosopher, invented the phrase "trias politica" or "separation of powers." Thus, separation of powers refers to the division of government duties into different segments to prevent anyone department from performing the fundamental activities. The objective is to minimize power concentration and to create checks and balances. Although the Indian Constitution does not strictly provide for the separation of powers, some articles offer general guidance on how the powers are separated; however, these articles are mainly applicable to the separation of powers for the Judiciary from the Executive and legislative branches. Article 50[i]<a href="#ref1">1</a> specifies that the State or Government concerned would take reasonable efforts to guarantee that the judicial branch is distinct from the functioning and operation of the executive branch. According to Article 361[vi]<a href="#ref2">2</a>, the President or any governor of any state is not answerable to any court in the country for acts and activities conducted in performance/exercise of their powers and responsibilities. Both articles separated the Judiciary from the Executive </p> <p>In contrast, Articles 121[ii]<a href="#ref3">3</a> and 211[iii]<a href="#ref4">4</a> states that the administration of justice or how a judge discharges his duties of any Court cannot be discussed in the Legislature. Articles 122[iv]<a href="#ref5">5</a> and 212[v]<a href="#ref6">6</a> deprive the Judiciary of any power to review and question the validity of proceedings in a legislature or the Parliament, separating the Judiciary from legislative. However, there is no clear separation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches. </p> <h2 id="sec-overlapping-of-powers">Overlapping of Powers</h2> <p>While separation of powers is essential to the functioning of the Indian Government, no democratic system exists with a complete separation of powers or, for that matter, a complete lack of separation of powers. Governmental authorities and duties are purposefully overlapping; they are too complicated and interconnected to be cleanly segregated. As a result, there is some level of competition and conflict among the organs of Government. Every organ's actual functioning overlap with the other two organs of Government in specific ways. This overlapping allows the organs to function as a check on each other without interfering too much. For example, According to Article 142[vii]<a href="#ref7">7</a>, the Supreme Court acts as an Executive to achieve complete justice. The Judiciary can also evaluate executive action to see if it breaches the Constitution. That is how the Judiciary interfere with the Executive and legislative branches when required. The Executive appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges. This demonstrates further overlapping, as the Executive may impact the functioning of the Judiciary in this way. Ordinarily, the Legislature has complete legislative authority, but the President may be authorized to exercise legislative authority under specific circumstances. For example, while the Parliament is not in session, the President may enact an ordinance under Article 123<a href="#ref8">8</a>, establishing the regulations in an emergency. Apart from overlapping powers between the Executive and Judiciary, the Indian systems also lack personnel separation between these departments. The council of ministers, for example, is a component of both the Executive and the Legislature. Another case in point is when a cabinet minister performs both executive and administrative duties. According to Article 74(1)<a href="#ref9">9</a>, the executive head is required to follow the recommendations of the cabinet ministers. The Supreme Court ruled in Ram Jawaya vs State of Punjab<a href="#ref10">10</a> that the Executive is a part of the legislative and must answer it. The three integral organs are interconnected, since India is a Parliamentary democracy. Although India does not have a rigid separation of powers like the American Constitution, a check and balance system is in place. However, no organs are to take over the fundamental activities of other organs that are part of the basic structure, even if altered. If amended, such change would be considered unconstitutional.</p> <h2 id="sec-pros-and-cons-of-the-overlap">Pros and Cons of the Overlap</h2> <p>The public's trust in the institutions of Government is critical in such a sophisticated and dynamic democracy. People's confidence in the organs' quality, efficiency, and integrity is eroded due to their recurrent intrusions into other organ's decisions. It weakens the spirit of democracy because the concentration of power in government institutions undermines the idea of checks and balances. </p> <p>The most significant overlap concern may be that any, one specific organ cannot be held accountable for its action. On the other hand, enabling power-sharing rules improves accountability and equity on the part of the Government. The overlap prohibits arbitrary acts by the other two branches of Government. One example of the same could be the judicial review authority of the Apex Court of India. The delineation of overriding powers in the Constitution reduces the potential of dispute among government organs. Moreover, the overlapping functions promote power-sharing and power decentralization, guaranteeing that the three organs can work together to address problems more quickly. </p> <h2 id="sec-conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Both separation of powers and overlapping powers have advantages and disadvantages. Even if separation of powers cannot be enforced strictly in any modern country such as the United States, Nepal, France, and so on, this theory is still relevant today. Though, some may claim that it slows the system down, it is vital for a constitutional system's smooth and correct operation. This theory is critical because it preserves an individual's liberty against arbitrary control and prevents organs from usurping the vital tasks of other organs. On the other hand, overlapping of powers has its benefits. Our government is a well-organized institution, and it is difficult to segregate it into watertight units. Cooperation and coordination among all three branches of Government are required for the successful running of any government. A Parliamentary system with a strict separation of powers is unnecessary and unsustainable for a democratic country with a diverse population like India. Nonetheless, with judicial and calibrated constitutional functional overlap, the institutional cooperation of the three government organs is feasible. This type of collaboration bridges the legislative, executive, and judicial barriers, allowing the Government to function smoothly.</p> <hr> <h3 id="sec-references"><em>References</em></h3> <ol> <li id="ref1">Item 1</li> <li id="ref2">List Item</li> <li id="ref3">List Item</li> <li id="ref4">List Item</li> <li id="ref5">List Item</li> <li id="ref6">List Item</li> <li id="ref7">List Item</li> <li id="ref8">List Item</li> <li id="ref9">List Item</li> <li id="ref10">List Item</li> </ol>{% endblock editorialpost %}''')

History has witnessed various communities assuming the solitary responsibility of sheltering their faith, irrespective of how radical their chosen methodologies might be. Often, these means go against the fundamental humanitarian ideals, and the world gets subjected to horrific episodes of destruction and genocide. An insatiable thirst of assuming the highest of authority is, indeed, insatiable. Be it the Nazi Revolution aiming to form a homogenous, political entity occupied only by people belonging to a certain "pure Aryan race" or the ongoing, seemingly, and arguably dormant Hindutva movement by the ruling political party of the Republic of India. The following paper attempts to answer the evergreen question of what secularism and communalism mean for the Indian population, especially against the backdrop of the rising Hindutva patriotism and pseudo-nationalism.</p> <h2 id="sec-introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>A human is said to be a social animal. Since time immemorial, our civilisations have established themselves on the virtues of mutual co-operation and collaborative efforts. Be it the Roman Civilisation, Indus Valley civilisation, the Mayan Civilisation, or the Greeks, all of them emerged due to the division of labour and establishment of societies. In any society, people occupying the same geographical region or working in the same economic setup identify themselves as a part of that shared community. Anyone out of this entanglement is usually termed a foreigner, seemingly alien to their customs and traditions, more often than not, met with hostility and suspicion. This is the animalistic tendency of human nature that acts as a buttress for the "divide and rule" politics, utilising which the British empire rooted its hold over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for almost two centuries. </p> <p>The Indian subcontinent, globally renowned for its unity in diversity, is a perfect amalgamation of people, following different religions, belonging to different class groups, associating themselves with different castes, carrying out different customs, and speaking different languages, while living in harmony. However, in a society as heterogenous as ours, this <em>harmony</em> is exceptionally fragile and requires constant caretaking. The subcontinent had sung the dream of freedom from the British rule through a collaborative spirit of combined struggle and unity amongst Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs. Seventy years ago, our people were successful in acquiring this freedom. However, it did not come without a cost. The subcontinent was partitioned into Hindu-majority, India, and Muslim-majority, Pakistan, sparking one of the largest forced migration the world has ever seen, Muslims to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to India. Over 10 million people were on the move. Sectarian violence followed, with, up to a million people dying and tens of thousands of women abducted and raped. The feeling of "us" versus "them" strengthened even further, and the wicked forces found the Indian unity in the most vulnerable state possible. </p> <p>Partition generated memories, hatred, stereotypes, and identities that continue to shape the history of people on both sides of the border. What followed was an attempt to build a nation that promoted the ideals of individual liberty and secularism. However, in a country where community-based existence has been the backbone of the society and where the smallest brick of this societal setup is a family, promoting the infamous "western" notions of individualism was not effortless. Through the means of this paper, we will attempt to answer all these concerns, in addition to how the majoritarian ideals of Hinduism, and the rise of Hindutva ideologies, shaped the political environment, thereafter redefining secularism and communalism in the Indian context. </p> <h2 id="sec-the-feeling-of-us-vs-them">The feeling of "Us" vs "Them"</h2> <p>Trust and unity played an immense role in the harmonious living of the varied groups of people in the subcontinental region. For centuries, the two majority religious communities of the country, Hindus, and Muslims had lived in peace under the dynastic rule of countless monarchs. Allegiances and adherence of people to their nation or government were never scrutinised to the degree that they hinder the enjoyment of anyone's fundamental rights. According to popular mistaken belief, the loyalty of the Muslim population lies with Pakistan. Thus, the religious community will never be able to accept the principles of Hindutva living (elaboration on this in further segments). The stereotype of the extra-territorial pan-Islamic loyalties comes fused with other highly objectionable ideas, as well. These ideas paint the Muslim population as cruel, bigoted, unclean, and descendants of invaders while Hindus as dark, cowardly, polytheist and lost beings. Though all these stereotypes predate the Partition era, they, indeed, strengthened and got cemented due to it. </p> <p>The next step in widening the gap between "us" vs "them" comes with the practice of communalism. Communalism refers to a politics that seeks to unify one community around a religious identity in hostile opposition to another community. Communalism can be both-sided; it might nurture politics of hatred for an identified "other"- "Hindus" in the case of Muslim communalism, and "Muslims" in the case of Hindu communalism. This hatred goes on to feed the politics of violence. When combined with the ideals of Hindutva and Hindu Raj, this politicisation leads to pseudo or religious nationalism. In such an environment, any attempt to see a religious community as a "national identity" would mean sowing the seeds of antagonism against some other religion. </p> <p>Assassinations of Indian activist Narendra Dabholkar, Comrade Govind Pansare, scholar M. M. Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh, all known to be rationalists in their approaches and staunch critics of the Hindu extremism spreading across the country, are vivid examples of how, when one authority assumes the sole responsibility to protect their radical faith and religion, it often leads to episodes of horrific tragedies which question the very existence of our sacred constitution and the democratic setup. In a world of extremisms, no one, whose ideals and beliefs stand in contrast to that of the majoritarian lens, can enjoy even their basic rights like freedom of speech and expression, or, looking at the cases mentioned earlier, right to life, for that matter. </p> <p>Up until the infamous national emergency, the political scenario, though occasionally tense and dynamic, was rarely of communal nature. Much of the criticisms or appraisals directed towards the six-time, General Elections winning (until the 1980s) political party of the country, the Indian National Congress, were based on their competency and objective in nature. It seemed like after decades, Indian politics had administered and healed the wounds left behind by the bloody partition. However, the era after the 1980s was the first time when the opposition started mobilising on the alleged Congress motives for the "appeasement of Muslims." This brought religion-based politics into the picture.  </p> <h2 id="sec-difference-between-hinduism-and-hindutva">Difference between Hinduism and Hindutva</h2> <p>India from the early 1980s started witnessing the rise of politics based on religious identities. On Bhartiya Janata Party's initial failure to build its political career based on the principles of 'Gandhian Socialism,' the party began to emphasise on the Hindu nationalist elements by focusing on pursuing the politics of Hindutva. This they did by mobilising Hindus, especially those from upper caste economically stronger strata of the society. To understand what religion-based politics is, we will have to first define the ideology of Hindutva. </p> <p>Hindutva literally means "<em>hinduness</em>" and was defined by its originator, V. D. Savarkar, as the basis of Indian nationhood, which he said was synonymous with "Hindu nationhood" (Tharoor 143). The basic principles of Hindutva and the politics related to this ideology were based on three notions. It fundamentally meant that to be a member of the Indian, thus Hindu, nation, everyone must not only accept India as their fatherland (<em>pitrbhumi</em>) but also as their holy land (<em>punya bhumi</em>) (Tharoor 143). His argument was simple in the sense that he believed a strong nation could be built only based on a solid and united national, homogenous culture. In the case of India (because India is the birthplace of Hinduism), Hinduism was the only religion with the capabilities to "unite" every citizen under one umbrella. This form of political stifling leads to hatred of one community towards the other. </p> <p>While Hindutva focuses primarily on the mobilisation and extremist measures of a rather misguided political unity, which in turn leads to exclusion from the "other" (Muslims, in this case), Hinduism is more of an inward-directed faith. Hinduism primarily focuses on self-realization and not merely respects; however, it necessitates the ideals of secularism. It focuses on the union of the soul with the Absolute power. Hindutva, on the contrary, is an outward-directed concept with the objective of establishing and propagating social and cultural distinctions for political advantage. Tharoor has written that Hindutva, in fact, stands on the opposite side of what Hinduism, as a religion, promotes. He mentions that according to Swami Vivekananda, what should be seen as the strengths of Hinduism- its extraordinary eclecticism and diversity, its refusal to confine itself to the dogmas of a single holy book, its fluidity, the impossibility to define it down to homogenous 'Semitic' creed- is precisely what the <em>Hindutvavadis </em>or the <em>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh </em>sees as its weakness (Tharoor 196).</p> <p>Nonetheless, it is a widespread perception that history repeats its course. This is evidently visible when <em>Hindutvavadis </em>attempt to justify the assassination of the activists mentioned above, like Narendra Dabholkar and others, by condemning their rationalist ideals to be solely directed towards the appeasement of Muslims. This extremist majoritarian belief is what had led to the assassination of the father of our nation, Shri Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, in 1948. Late Govind Pansare had gone on record to say that the ideology that led to Mahatma Gandhi's assassination is the same that killed, and still kills, rationalists and journalists who believe in practising their fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression (Patwardhan, 2018, 0:14:45). According to the extremists, any opinion which goes against their chosen faith and ideology is "anti-national" and thus hostile to the sovereignty and existence of the "Hindu republic of India."</p> <p>Secularism, hence, in the Indian context, takes an entirely different connotation altogether. The secularism, which has been asseverated and publicly acknowledged by the Indian politicians, runs on the principle of 'keeping apart from the religion.' This principle means to keep the governmental machinery entirely out of the equation and not in direct or indirect interaction with the religious matters of the citizens. However, whenever the government makes special provisions of reservation, or provisions to strengthen or support certain marginal sects or supressed religion-based/caste-based minorities, this principle stands purposeless. In such a scenario, the Indian government should observe the practice of 'not favouring any particular sect or faith' rather than 'maintaining a distance or keeping apart from all religions.' Tharoor has also acknowledged the same principle and termed 'secularism' a misnomer in the Indian context of profuse religiosity (142). He terms the latter idea as 'pluralism' and observes it as the Indian form of secularism (142). </p> <h2 id="sec-the-uncanny-parallels-from-the-second-world-war">The uncanny parallels from the second World War</h2> <p>As mentioned before, as well, V.D. Savarkar believed that a strong nation could be built only based on a strong and united national, homogenous culture. Another man, immortal in the pages of history, once said that: </p> <p class="text-center"><em>"The state is only the vessel, and the race is what it contains. The vessel can only have meaning if it preserves and safeguards the contents … The supreme purpose of the ethical state is to guard and preserve those racial elements (Hitler 358)." </em></p> <p>The man was no one other than Adolf Hitler himself. The "state" that he talks about was Germany and the German-occupied territory during the second world war, and the race which the said state needs to protect was the pure Aryan race, which supposedly was in danger from the "impure" Jews. He had a very clear idea about the ethnic makeup of the nation. However, according to him, 'The state' was not an economic organisation; it was a 'volkic organism' (Weaver). Based on this principle, Hitler believed that the 'volkisch' concept separated mankind into races of superior and inferior quality (Hitler 348). He became successful in establishing the discourse of 'us' versus 'them', basing his argument on this racial hierarchy. This led to the formation of a new form of nationalism, nationalism based upon bloodlines and race. It stood exclusively contrary to the more inclusive form of nationalism, the civic nationalism. Civic nationalism bases its memberships upon mutual beliefs and values. </p> <p>If one observes closely, one cannot avoid drawing parallels of the fascist agendas during the second world war with the current political ecosystem in India. According to Prabhat Patnaik, the Hindutva movement, at least in the manner it has progressed, is almost, in a rudimentary sense, fascist in its ideologies, fascist in its class support, fascist in its methodologies, fascist in its programme (69). He compares the ingredients of the fascist ideology. He points out their presence in the radical Hindutva ideology being practised in the country: the attempt to unify the majority under a homogenised concept, 'the Hindus'; a sense of grievance against alleged injustices done to this homogeneous group in the past by an excluded homogeneous minority; a sense of cultural superiority; a reinterpretation of history exclusively in these terms; a total rejection of contrary evidence, of dispassionate analysis, of the scientific method of rational discourse; and above all an appeal to the so-called homogeneous majority in passionate, blood- curdling, and essentially male chauvinist terms to 'stand up,' 'assert their manhood,' 'show that it is blood, not water that flows in their veins,' all of which amount to an incitement to violence, and result in actual violence, against the minority group (Patnaik 69). </p> <p>In fact, this form of toxic masculinity plays a part, and affects not just politics, but different aspects of our human living. Furthering, we will be discussing its impact on the violent acts of lynching and attempt to draw a parallel to the horrendous act of rape, virtually, and arguably, the "best" portrayal of this toxic masculinity. </p> <h2 id="sec-a-future-beyond-comprehension">A future beyond comprehension?</h2> <p>It would be a grave injustice if we discuss communal politics and leave lynching out of the picture. Lynching is not just a mere murder. In the words of Aparna Vaidik, lynching, where a mob captures, drags, maims, and hangs another human, is very much like a gang rape in its symbolism (117). </p> <p>The heinous crime of rape is rarely solely about the sexual pleasure and more about the inherently atrocious social conditioning which teaches men in our societies that they are intrinsically dominating in nature. It teaches men that the only way to practise and showcase their masculinity  is to acquire complete control over the situation and, hence, over the bodies of others. It is more about the violence and the insecurities associated with it than the carnal nature of the act. Transferring the discussion, even the act of lynching is seldom about the circumstances that are present at that time, and more about the protection of one's believes and faith. The "stakeholders" actively demonstrate the fragility of their faith, like the rapist depicts the fragility of his masculinity, and commits actions that glue the cracks, keeps their insecurities taped, and holds it together on a momentary basis. </p> <p>Lynching is a form of collective, retributive justice that the majority community carries out in the name of righting the historical injustice (Vaidik 117). It is a public demonstration and hailed as a spectacle of the supposed moral superiority of the majoritarian community, especially in the Indian context. Often, the majoritarian community resorts to this act and uses it as a weapon against caste and religious minorities. They do so in the name of restoring their honour. The "beef vigilante" groups polluting and populating every nook and corner of the city streets have started using it as a legitimate customary practice. India is gradually becoming indifferent to, or tolerant of the violence because of its excess. Every episode of lynching on religious lines entrenches the Hindu supremacist sense. The sense paints the <em>Hindus</em> as a historical victim, criminalising the minority religious and caste communities. Vaidik writes that at the core of every lynching is the Hindu fear of the lustful Dalit or Muslim man, who is after the Hindu cow and Hindu women (i.e., enacting love jihad). The supposed victim is the Hindu supremacist, whose woman, as if his property, was and still is, allegedly being violated for centuries (121). Under Hindutva rule, thus, violence has been freely expressed, propagated, and justified in the name of enacting social justice. </p> <h2 id="sec-conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Tantamount to rape, if the society has to fight the evils of lynching and communal assassinations, and if the society wants to build an environment where each individual has the most supreme of all rights, the human right of allowance to every individual to actually put in practise the enjoyment of their fundamental and other legal rights, we as the members of this society will have to make striving efforts to make it happen. The current model of the society would require a complete revamping. This revamping needs to start at the grass-root levels. Education plays a significant role in this regard. Virtues of harmonious living and accommodation need to be taught to our citizens, from a very early age, rather than teaching them to take charge and offense over menial issues and demonstrate the "manly man" they are by dominating the situations which do not require them intervening. It is truly despicable for them to believe that their faith, their customs, necessitate them to go through leaps and bounds to provide it with protection, often adopting radical methods. </p> <p>A system of checks and balances, interspersed with measures for accountability from the ruling government, is a pressing need of the hour. A party that has acquired a majority in both the house of the government and manages to form government in various states of the country has imperceptible authority, and equally high chances of misusing these powers if its intentions are not set in the right path. Democracy is for the people of the people and, most importantly, by the people. This means that the democratic ideas are only as cemented as the citizens of that country strive, every day, for them to be. Overthrowing an elected representative setup is not impossible, and a domineering, authoritative figure can do so at the first opportunity it gets. Our faith, our religion, is not what needs our protection; however, our democratic setup and our sacred constitution do.  </p> <hr> <h3 id="sec-references"><em>References</em></h3> <ol> <li class="text-left" id="ref1">Hitler, A., & Manheim, R.
